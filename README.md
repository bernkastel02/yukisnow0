<hr />

hi there, i'm [Yuki](https://github.com/yukisnow0), and i'm a japanese 18 year old living in america whose passionate and fully self-taught software engineer who primarily dabbles in the backend. i'm not one for front end, but i wont hesitate to get my hands wet in it if needed to. my passions underlie in making sure my programs and libraries are easily usable and understandable, so that i and my future peers can work on them easily. usually, this makes it much nicer for developers who use my REST APIs, as well as the other similar architectures that i create and manifest.

i am also an avid freelancer, who loves to maintain high and cool projects, as well as open-source softwares. i owe my skill to the open source community, and i couldn't be where i am without it.

<br />

	conventions = [snake_case, PascalCase]; // properties & functions, classes

Always in a rush<br />
Never stay on the phone long enough<br />
Why am I so self-important?<br />
Said I'd see you soon<br />
That was, oh, maybe a year ago<br />
Didn't know time was of the essence<br />
<br />
So many questions<br />
But I'm talking to myself<br />
I know that you can't hear me anymore<br />
Not anymore<br />
So much to tell you<br />
And most of all goodbye<br />
But I know that you can't hear me any more<br />
<br />
It's so loud inside my head<br />
With words that I should have said<br />
As I drown in my regrets<br />
I can't take back the words I never said<br />
I never said<br />
I can't take back the words I never said<br />
I never said<br />
I can't take back the words I never said<br />
<br />
It's so loud inside my head<br />
With words that I should have said<br />
As I drown in my regrets<br />
I can't take back the words I never said<br />
<br />
Always talking shit<br />
Took your advice and did the opposite<br />
Just being young and stupid<br />
I haven't been all that you could've hoped for<br />
But if you'd held on a little longer<br />
You'd have had more reasons to be proud<br />
<br />
So many questions<br />
But I'm talking to myself<br />
I know that you can't hear me any more<br />
Not anymore<br />
So much to tell you<br />
And most of all goodbye<br />
But I know that you can't hear me any more<br />
<br />
It's so loud inside my head<br />
With words that I should have said<br />
And as I drown in my regrets<br />
I can't take back the words<br />
<br />
The longer I stand here<br />
The louder the silence<br />
I know that you're gone but sometimes I swear that I hear<br />
Your voice when the wind blows<br />
So I talk to the shadows<br />
Hoping you might be listening 'cause I want you to know<br />
<br />
It's so loud inside my head<br />
With words that I should have said<br />
And as I drown in my regrets<br />
I can't take back the words I never said<br />
I never said<br />
I can't take back the words I never said<br />
I never said<br />
I can't take back the words I never said
