<hr />

hi there, i'm [Yuki](https://github.com/yukisnow0), and i'm a japanese 18 year old living in america whose passionate and fully self-taught software engineer who primarily dabbles in the backend. i'm not one for front end, but i wont hesitate to get my hands wet in it if needed to. my passions underlie in making sure my programs and libraries are easily usable and understandable, so that i and my future peers can work on them easily. usually, this makes it much nicer for developers who use my REST APIs, as well as the other similar architectures that i create and manifest.

i am also an avid freelancer, who loves to maintain high and cool projects, as well as open-source softwares. i owe my skill to the open source community, and i couldn't be where i am without it.

	current_projects = [];
	conventions = [snake_case, PascalCase]; // properties & functions, classes
		
	constructor() {
		super("JavaScript"); // programmer constructor takes a main language parameter
		
		// do it if you dare.
		this.pattable = false;
	}
