<hr />

hi there, i'm [Yuki](https://github.com/yukisnow0), and i'm a japanese 18 year old living in america whose passionate and fully self-taught software engineer who primarily dabbles in the backend. i'm not one for front end, but i wont hesitate to get my hands wet in it if needed to. my passions underlie in making sure my programs and libraries are easily usable and understandable, so that i and my future peers can work on them easily. usually, this makes it much nicer for developers who use my REST APIs, as well as the other similar architectures that i create and manifest.

i am also an avid freelancer, who loves to maintain high and cool projects, as well as open-source softwares. i owe my skill to the open source community, and i couldn't be where i am without it.

<br />

All my friends tell me I should move on<br />
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song<br />
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh<br />
That's how you sang it<br />
<br />
Loving you forever, can't be wrong<br />
Even though you're not here, won't move on<br />
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh<br />
That's how we played it<br />
<br />
And there's no remedy<br />
For memory<br />
Your face is like a melody<br />
It won't leave my head<br />
Your soul is haunting me<br />
And telling me<br />
That everything is fine<br />
But I wish I was dead<br />
(Dead like you)<br />
<br />
Every time I close my eyes<br />
It's like a dark paradise<br />
No one compares to you<br />
I'm scared that you<br />
Won't be waiting on the other side<br />
Every time I close my eyes<br />
It's like a dark paradise<br />
No one compares to you<br />
I'm scared that you<br />
Won't be waiting on the other side<br />
<br />
All my friends ask me why I stay strong<br />
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on<br />
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh<br />
That's why I stay here<br />
<br />
And there's no remedy<br />
For memory<br />
Your face is like a melody<br />
It won't leave my head<br />
Your soul is haunting me<br />
And telling me<br />
That everything is fine<br />
But I wish I was dead<br />
(Dead like you)<br />
<br />
Every time I close my eyes<br />
It's like a dark paradise<br />
No one compares to you<br />
I'm scared that you<br />
Won't be waiting on the other side<br />
Every time I close my eyes<br />
It's like a dark paradise<br />
No one compares to you<br />
But there's no you<br />
Except in my dreams tonight<br />
<br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah<br />
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight<br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah<br />
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight<br />
<br />
There's no relief<br />
I see you in my sleep<br />
And everybody's rushing me<br />
But I can feel you touching me<br />
There's no release<br />
I feel you in my dreams<br />
Telling me I'm fine<br />
<br />
Every time I close my eyes<br />
It's like a dark paradise<br />
No one compares to you<br />
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (So tell me)<br />
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise<br />
No one compares to you<br />
But there's no you<br />
Except in my dreams tonight<br />
<br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah<br />
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight<br />
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah<br />
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
